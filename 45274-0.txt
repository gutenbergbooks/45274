[Illustration: 0019]

|There's a character very well known, Who bubbles for ages has blown;

````From a Copperhead pipe have been thrown.

[Illustration: 0020]

````_"And what Stock he springs of!!"--Coriolan, II. 3._

|Copper stocks are uncertain to buy, though this Copperhead's stock's very high;

````By adding the _right_ sort of tie.

[Illustration: 0021]

````To kill the vile Copperhead worms.

[Illustration: 0023]

```_"There are many complaints, Davy, about that."--King Henry IV., V. 1._

|There was a Stern Statesman astute, who so often went in to _recruit_,

[Illustration: 0025]

_"And so the lion vanished."--Midsummer Night's Dream, V. 1._

|While it did us great harm, Abolition was the height of the Lion's ambition;

```Now with Copperhead _tale_ he stings himself pale.

````And furaciously scorns Abolition.

[Illustration: 0026]

```_"Will this Wood take fire?"--Merry Wives of Windsor, V. 5._

|Union, a fagot we take; But 'twould be a tremendous mistake,

```To use rotten old Wood which never was good,

````And then bind it up with a Snake.

[Illustration: 0027]

|There once was a Patriot whose rigor reached such a remarkable figure,

```That he'd rather go down in the water and drown

````Than be saved by the help of a nigger.

[Illustration: 0028]

|I like such Brooks," said Falstaff once;

``Had he meant _ours_ he'd been a dunce;

`The devil, whom all things evil please,

``Could never stand such Bruoks as these.=



`In the Tyrol on mountain high

``"The Devil's Marble" you may spy;

`And if in the World you long remain,

``You'll probably meet the same again.=



`Och, Johnny, my gun--let the truth be aid,

``What the divil made _ye_ turn Copperhid?

`Sure it was hivvy what ye bore,

``Wid the brass in your face yees had before.=



`There's a song how Old Nick took a journey,

``With a corporation attorney;

`But there is one _fouler_, whom even the old prowler

``Would fear as a friend on a journey.=



1.

`"The man who made that order," said

``Judge B. in court, "was a _meat-head_."

`Oh what a head that head would be,

``Just _meted_ Judge, to match with thee!=



2.

`"Just roll that nigger out of court!"

``The Judge exclaimed with solemn port;

`"I tell you very truly now,

``Nigs _at the bar_ I won't allow!"=



`At a Copperhead meeting the crier

``Paused an instant to hear his gun fire;

`The cannon was loaded, and when it exploded,

``Said he--"List to the voice of our sire!"=



``There was old party named M------,

``Who went from bad doctrines to worse.

`If at law he should see his name prefaced by _re,_

``It will show what he _should_ feel; this M------.=



```There was a small Cozening shyster;

``Said he, "Every case is an _eyester;_

`Give the parties the shells if you can, and nought else,

``Unless the Court tips you a hi-ster."=



``There's a man at the _Bar_ who, we know,

``Is in politics terribly _low_;

`For he keeps in the clubs the secessional cubs,

``Who in _propria persona_ can't go.=



``There's a very bad-minis-trator,

``A_ tr√®s petite pomme de tater_,

`Who tears feelings to rags, presenting of flags;

``This oily old adminis-_traitor_.=



``There's a wide-awake Copperhead cratur',

``Who is Eli by name and by natur';

`Displaying for one neither fashion _nor ton_,

``This un-national nativist traitor.=




CHECKER-BOARDERS AND KEYSTONERS


|There was an old person, J. B.,

``An old Public Func-tion-arie;  [agreed,

`When they swore, "We'll secede!" he just smiled, "I'm

``"You've a sure friend, you know, in J. B.=



``There was a smart lawyer named W------

``Who from Union men made quite a fortun';

`But his wealth he despised, with Secesh fraternized,

``This apo-state-olical W------.=



``There was a twistortulous Heed,

``Who hoped that Secesh might succeed;

`For he said, "It's my natur' to act like a traitor,

``Since it runs in the joints of a Heed."=



``There once was a Copperhead Diddle,

``Who played to the Heed second fiddle;

`When they said, "It is small!" it replied, not at all,

`Says he, "I ain't dead--as a live Copperhead

``I'm a squirmulous vermiform Wriggler."=



``There was an old servant called Peter,

``So moody in humor and feature

`Because the good people from the church with a steeple

``Expelled this old saturnine Peter.=



``There was a sharp lawyer, one P-,

``Whose thoughts never got through his still lips;

`And all he would say was "ah!" "h'm!" "oh!" and "ay

``This pauciloquent person named P-.=



``There was a neat sarpent--a Coiler--

``True son of the ancient Beguiler;

`Who told such a whopper, he burst out his copper,

``And frightfully fractured his biler.=



`It's a full-blooded Copperhead Diddle!"=


`There was an ex-governing Wiggler,

`A political huckster and higgler;

``Quoth "Aristocracy"

``To Fourth Ward "Vulgarity,"

`"You are dregs, I am froth; and our interests both

MODERN HEATHEN-IANS


``There was an ex-editor, L------,

``Who rowed in the _Courier_ punt,

`But to twist around more, he jumped out on the shore,

``That contortious poetical L------.=



``Oh G------ T------ C------ was one

``Who thought himself quite a great gun;

`So Treason he shouted, "Constitution" he spouted,

``To the cause of his country adverse,

``Is the man whom all honest men curse.

`Do you ask what's his name? oh, ne'er believe Fame,

``In Eighteen Hundred and Fifty-Six,

``A poet, disgusted with Pierce's tricks,

``Said that he down to the dust should go,

``Gamblers, Wood-ites, thieves, and asses,

``Scrapings of the dangerous classes,

SHAKSPEARE ON THE COPPERHEADS.


```"What would you have, you curs,

`That like nor peace nor war? The one affrights you,

`The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,

`Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;

`Where foxes, geese; you are no surer, no,

`Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,

`Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is,

`To make him worthy whose offence subdues him,

`And curse that justice did it. Who deserves greatness

`Deserves your hate; and your affections are

`A sick man's appetite, who desires most that

`Which would increase his evil. He that depends

`Upon your favors swims with fins of lead,

`And hews down oaks with rushes."--_Coriolanus, I. 1._




"THOSE DEVOTED COPPERHEADS."


`"Our sympathies are all confined at home; yet it is just

`possible we may help those devoted Copperheads in the only

`way we know how--also, that they, on their side, are now

`about ripe to aid us in the only way we could accept their

`aid. If our troops should this summer appear within their

`borders anywhere between Cairo and Philadelphia, they would

`be hailed as friends by a population pretty well cured now of

`_Pluribus Unum_. Their cry would be, not Union, but deli-

`verance. _Wait then, and watch, and keep your lights burning,

`ye Knights of the Golden Circle!"--Richmond Enquirer_, 18th

`May, 1863.
